# simpleGIS
The project aims to satisfy this need by providing a Simple GIS planning solution in the form of a web application whereby the user can create and edit multiple planned network routes on a live satellite map. Using multiple markers with latitude and longitude data to pinpoint junctions, nodes, etc. , this application will enable amateur users to create and export multiple grids as layers â€“ depending on the size of the project. This will enable the community to have a greater foothold in the designing of the grid 

## Launching the App
To launch local database from console:
`mongod --dbpath " ../path/to/db" `
