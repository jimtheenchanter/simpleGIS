# simpleGIS
The project aims to satisfy this need by providing a Simple GIS planning solution in the form of a web application whereby the user can create and edit multiple planned network routes on a live satellite map. Using multiple markers with latitude and longitude data to pinpoint junctions, nodes, etc. , this application will enable amateur users to create and export multiple grids as layers â€“ depending on the size of the project. This will enable the community to have a greater foothold in the designing of the grid 

## Launching the App

leaflet:
What Leaflet does: "Slippy" maps with tiled base layers, panning and zooming, and feature layers that you supply. It handles various basic tasks like converting data to map layers and mouse interactions, and it's easy to extend with plugins. It will also work well across most types of devices
